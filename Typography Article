A comparison of 2 different websites. 
Like & Dislike

An example of a website that I like for its typography is 
AJ Designs.com 
A beautiful combination of sans serif fonts with modern styling.
Subtle, interactive design elements that add visual interest.

An example of a website that I dislike for its typography is
gatesnfences.com
This site  has tiny text with low color contrast against the
 background, especially on its mobile version, making it hard 
 to read. The overall design is cluttered.
