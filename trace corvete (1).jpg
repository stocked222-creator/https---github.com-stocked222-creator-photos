Animate Infographic Project
 The purpose of this project is to create an animated infographic explaining a product.
 The asset I chose to use for this project is a photo of my friend's Corvette. I used this 
photo with my friend's permission.
 I used Adobe Illustrator to create a trace image of the corvette using the trace option in 
the contextual task bar.
 I used the text tool on the left side of the panel to create the words for my infographic.
 I exported my images and text assets as a PDF so that I could import them into Adobe 
Animate.
 I imported my assets into Adobe animate.
 I used the transform tool to select the scale tool to adjust the size of my images. 
I also used the transform tool to use the scale & skew tool to create a slanted effect to my 
immages.
 I used the selection tool to place the words in the location I wanted them in and to also 
place the images into the locations I wanted them in.
 I used the color panel to select the color for the words.
 I used the selection tool to select the parts of the infographic that I wanted to create an 
animated effect to.
 I used the motion presets tool to select the animations I wanted to create various 
movements in my infographic. 
I used the actions panel to create various actions in my infographic
 The challenges I faced with this project were trying to figure out how to put each part of 
my infographic on different layers. It also took me some time figure out how to create the 
actual animations/movements.
