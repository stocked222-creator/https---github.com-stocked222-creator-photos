Color Theory comparison of 2 different websites. One website that I dislike 
and one website that I like.

https://www.windows93.net/
This website has a very loud color theme. The background color is too bold 
and intense and makes it a bit difficult to see the icons and read the text under them.

This website utilizes dark colors  with bright colors in a stunning design style. . 
The websiteâ€™s  design , vibrant colors and interactive elements  enhance the overall
 user experience. By blending bold  design styles it smoothly achieves a colorful tone
 and creates a captivating, memorable atmosphere. I really like the  bold, colorful website
 design.I feel it  grabs visitors with its  visuals and unique, dramatic approach to storytelling.
